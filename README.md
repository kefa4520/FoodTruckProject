## Food Truck Project

### Overview
Users will input and rate a list of food trucks. The program allows to view the list of trucks entered, view the average rating and the highest rated truck.

### Technologies Used
- Eclipse
- Java
- Terminal Commands
- GitHub
- Google
- Stack Overflow


### Lessons Learned
- Had to review: Classes and objects, as well as how to declare and initialize arrays.

- Issues that came up : encountered a Java issue with Scanner.nextLine(). After entering the numerical value, the first input.nextLine() is skipped and the second input.nextLine() is executed. Stack Overflow served as a great resource.

### MVP
The user is prompted to input the name, food type, and rating for up to five food trucks. The truck id is not input by the user, but instead assigned automatically.
- user enters data for up to five trucks;
- the user can quit inputting data and proceed with the program by entering "quit";

After input is complete, the user sees a menu from which they can choose to:

- List all existing food trucks.
- See the average rating of food trucks.
- Display the highest-rated food truck.
- Quit the program.
